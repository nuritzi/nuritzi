### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nuritzi and I'm a friendly person who loves open source, traveling, wine, and photography!

In my dayjob, I'm a Sr. Program Manager at Google. I'm based in California and I often travelt to Germany. 

I speak: English, Spanish, and Itialian. In that order. 

My passion for open source started in 2012 when I first learned about it. I care a lot about social impact, and I love that open source allows people to collaborate across the globe. Open source enables people to solve to the challenges that they see in their areas, and it is something that is based on the principle of freedom. 

As a non-engineer, I bring another set of skills to open source -- especially around strategy and operations. I deeply believe that it takes a diverse set of people to build technology that scales and which is sustainable. As a result, I do my best to create environments of inclusivity and where people feel excited to collaborate. 

I work at Google and lead the [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter) & [Dart](https://github.com/dart-lang) T/Pgm team (T/PgMs = Technical Program Manager and Program Managers). If you've never heard of that term, or want to know more about TPgMs, let me know! Happy to connect!
